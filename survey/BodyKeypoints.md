# Body Keypoints Detection

The keypoints and heatmaps are vital when it comes to body pose generation task. These consists of the textures of a person on a high level and also defines about the body pose/shape.

Since we are dealing with a full body pose generation, we should be able to tackle occlusion invariant pose detection module. 2d and 3d keypoint detections to be checked.

We need to look into CG based approaches rather CV alone. Then it would typically involve meshes/point cloud into the scenario.
