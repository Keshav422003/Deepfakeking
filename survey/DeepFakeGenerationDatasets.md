# Deep Fake Generation Datasets

To generate a full body deepfake we need to focus on

1. Clothing of the body
2. Body Shape details.
3. Facial Expressions.
4. Hand Signs and Leg movements.
5. Lip Movements.
6. Hair Colour and body skin tone to avoid the bias.
7. Teeth artifacts.

Typical dataset would include

1. Fashion Datasets - To get more varitey of clothes.
2. Sign Langauge Datasets - To get more robust views of hand signs.
3. Youtube videos of dances, talkshows - To get more diversity of leg movements.
4. Facial Experssion - Robust facial expression and views of person( yaw, pitch, roll).
